5 day weather forecast from selected cities. 
# <Nicole's-Weather-App>

## Description
This is a simple weather app to show forecasts for searchable cities. It uses the Clouflare API weather calls to find the data and then my job was to display certain aspects. This is helpful for people who are confused using a new weather app all the time; its simple and easy to use. I learned how hard it is to get an API to cooperate, but I lost enjoyed learning how to navigate around the data. 

## Installation
Nothing, just load the page. 

## Usage
Once page is loaded, simply type whole name for city you're looking for (i.e. "Seattle, Washington")
When you hit the "ENTER" button you will be provided with a forecast for the next week.

5 day weather forecast from selected cities. 
# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description
This is a simple weather app to show five day forecasts for searchable cities. It uses the Clouflare API weather calls to find the data and then my job was to display certain aspects. THis is helpful for people who are confused using a new weather app all the time. I learned how to make an app work with an API.
